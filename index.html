                <p>I've always been approached about my natural hair. Several questions about, how I get my curls to look "like that"? What products I use? What's my wash and go routine? What's a wash n go? What's a twist out? What's a braid out? What's the LOC method? What leave in would you recommend? What's a protective style? I mean you name it and I've most likely been asked it.</p>

                <p>Then, after all that questioning I would get hit with a "oh, you got that good hair", "I could NEVER go natural, it's not for me". Hearing these things, caused me to feel very frustrated. I felt this way because allowing your hair to return to its natural state is the best thing for African American women. There are so many studies on how the “creamy crack” affects our bodies. It can cause fibroids, can burn the scalp, can result in breakage if not used properly and the list goes on.</p>

                <p>After I went natural I began to do research on our natural hair, trying to figure out why we even left our natural roots. After much digging I began to realize it was a deeper rooted issue that seemed to be out of our hands. We've been conditioned to believe that everything about us isn't considered beautiful in the eyes of society, which in turn causes us to try and "fix" something we we're naturally born with.</p>

                <p>Also, within our own community we sometimes shame one another for rocking our TWA's (teeny weeny afros). We feel embarrassed for not having a certain curl pattern. Being insulted with the phrases such as “you have the bad hair” or “her hair is better because she has looser curls”. The reality is <b style="color: #EB8787">WE ALL HAVE GOOD HAIR</b>.</p>
