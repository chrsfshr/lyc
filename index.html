                <p>I've always been approached about my natural hair. Several questions about how I get my curls to look "like that", what products I use, what's my wash and go routine, what's a wash n go, what's a twist out, what's a braid out, what's the LOC method, what leave in would you recommend, what's a protective style, I mean you name it and I've most likely been asked it.</p>

                <p>Then, after all that questioning I would get hit with a "oh, you got that good hair", "I could NEVER go natural, it's not for me". That line in itself would make me feel very frustrated, I felt this way because allowing your hair to return to its natural state is the best thing for African American women. There are so many studies on how the “creamy crack” affects our bodies. It causes fibroids, can burn the scalp, can cause breakage if not used properly and the list goes on.</p>

                <p>After I went natural I began to do research on our natural hair, trying to figure out why we even left our natural roots. After much digging I began to realize it was a deeper rooted issue that seemed to be out of our hands. We've been conditioned to believe that everything about us isn't considered beautiful in the eyes of this cruel society, which in turn causes us try to and "fix" something we we're naturally born with. We've been told for so long straight hair is the standard of beauty and our hair is unruly, nappy, bad and needs to be "tamed".</p>

                <p>Also, within our own community we shame one another for rocking our TWA's (teeny weeny afros). We feel shamed for not having a certain curl pattern. Being insulted with the phrases such as “you have the bad hair” or “her hair is better because she has looser curls”. The reality is <b style="color: #EB8787">WE ALL HAVE GOOD HAIR</b>.</p>
